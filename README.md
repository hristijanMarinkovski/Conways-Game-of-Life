# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using sequential, parallel and (soon)distributed processing.

More info on Conway's Game of Life can be found in the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

This program randomizes a matrix given the dimentions and number of iteration cycles, processes it in the specified manner and outputs the game iteration states and final runtime statistics.

The program can be ran by typing the following command in the CLI while in the 'out\production\Conway''s Game of Life\' folder:
```
'java ConwaysGameOfLife'
```

Afterwards, just follow the CLI instructions.

The program is made with the purpose of showcasing the efficiency increase in different implementations.
