# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using sequential, parallel and (soon)distributed processing.

The program can be ran by typing the following command while in the src folder:
'java ConwaysGameOfLife'

Afterwards, just follow the CLI instructions.

The program is made with the purpose of showcasing the efficiency increase in different implementations, and as such, will provide runtime data when it finishes execution.
